word_finder
===========

Ruby program to find words in a word search puzzle

A word search is essentially a grid of letters. Manipulating the grid, the program scans it for words with
a length greater than 2 letters using a dictionary file. Words that are found are printed to standard out.

A user-defined grid can be used (follow the prompt). This should be a plaintext file that has
each row in the grid as a row of letters in the text file, no spaces!
A random grid will be generated otherwise
